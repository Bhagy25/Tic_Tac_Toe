A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

echo "# Tic-Tac-Toe Bot (Minimax AI)

This project is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where you (the player) play against an unbeatable bot using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features
- 3x3 board implementation using a 2D array
- Player vs AI mode (AI uses Minimax)
- Turn-based gameplay (randomized first move)
- Input validation
- Terminal-based UI

## Controls
Enter your move as two space-separated numbers corresponding to row and column (1-based indexing).

\`\`\`
Example: 1 3 -> top right corner
\`\`\`

## AI Logic
The bot uses the Minimax algorithm to choose the optimal move. It evaluates all possible moves and ensures it either wins or forces a draw â€” never losing.

## How to Compile and Run

\`\`\`bash
g++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
./tictactoe
\`\`\`

## Sample Output

\`\`\`
Player: o
Computer: x

## TODO / Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- GUI using libraries like SFML or SDL
- Multiplayer (2 player mode)
- Score tracking across multiple rounds
